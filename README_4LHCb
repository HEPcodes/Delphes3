Delphes 4 LHCb
==============

The card "delphes_card_LHCb.tcl" contains a preliminary parametrization of the LHCb detector. 

- ParticlePropagator

particles are propagated in a constant B field.

- ChargedHadronMomentumSmearing/ElectronEnergySmearing/MuonMomentumSmearing

charged particles momenta are smeared according to detector resolution

- TrackMerger

charged particles are merged into single collection for simpler future processing

- ImpactParameterSmearing

charged particles transverse IP are smeared according to known LHCb tracking
performance.


- IdentificationMap

This module is a recent addition in order to map particle misidentification rates
and reconstruction efficiencies. 

An example is given in the card but can be expanded if needed. 

- ECAL/HCAL

Calorimeter modules are used to parametrize the energy response and angular
resolution of neutral objects such as photons/neutral hadrons. 

- TreeWriter 

user specifies here which collections are stored in the output. 
By default tracks, neutral hadrons and photons are stored in this card.
Tracks contain muons, electrons, and charged hadrons. 


Quick start with Delphes
========================

1) Compile:

  make

2) Simulate p p -> b b~ events
